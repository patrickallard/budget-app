# Budget App :
 
## Description
The budget project was designed to be a lightweight, streamlined application to help users keep track of accounts, budgets, and
transactions associated with that particular user in a comprehensive list. 

## Technology Used
### 1. Angular
### 2. Spring Boot
### 3. Docker 

## Database Scheme
The database is made up of three entities: Accounts, Budgets, and Transactions. Accounts and Budgets are associated with Transactions in a One-to-Many bidirectional relationship. Below is rough sketch of the relationships I drew up when starting the project to help me visualize how the entities mapped to one another.
