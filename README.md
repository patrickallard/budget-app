# Budget App :
 
## Description
The budget project is a lightweight, streamlined application that helps users exercise better money management by tracking accounts, budgets, and
transactions. 

## Technology Used
1. Angular
2. Spring Boot
3. Docker 

## Database Scheme
The database is made up of three entities: Accounts, Budgets, and Transactions. Accounts and Budgets are associated with Transactions in a One-to-Many bidirectional relationship. Below is a rough sketch I drew up during the brainstorming phase to help me visualize how the database entities mapped to one another.
